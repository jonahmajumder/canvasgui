Python Canvas (Courseworks) GUI

This project builds on an open-source Python package "CanvasAPI", which is itself built to interact with Instructure's RESTful HTTP API. Using this package (and Qt for Python), I have created an interactive app allowing a user to browse and download courses, files, assignments, and other content.
